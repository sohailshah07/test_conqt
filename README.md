Project Test Submission

Overview:

This project was completed under special circumstances. Due to an issue with my personal system on the day of the test, I was unable to use it for development. As a result, I had to complete the test on my brother's laptop, which did not have the necessary development setup (e.g., Node.js, database software, etc.).

Key Considerations:

Please bear the following in mind while reviewing the test:

Focus: The majority of the work done focuses on database functionality according to the given task and setting up the structure as best as possible under the circumstances.

Potential Errors: Without access to the database, there may be errors in data interaction layers.

Scope: The incomplete sections, such as server.js and routes, are placeholders for the necessary logic that couldn't be tested or completed without a proper setup.
